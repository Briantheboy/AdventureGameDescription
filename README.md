# AdventureGameDescription
Premise: Play as Robbin' Robin, the worst thief who has ever lived. After your latest blunder of a heist, members in your crime ring are starting to realize your incompetence, and are considering kicking you out of their social circle. In a last ditch effort to prove your worthiness to all of them, you publicly announce a plan to steal the world's most expensive pair of salad tongs from "Silly Steve's Museum of Stuff" this Sunday. Since you have a reputation of being a screw up, the museum hasn’t bothered setting up any tighter security for the night. Getting the tongs should be a snap, right? RIGHT!?!


Character Bio: Robbin’ Robin (real name: Robin Roberto Robinson) is a horrible thief. He’s got a big heart, but is extremely clumsy. Ever since he was a young boy, he loved to steal stuff. He would frequently try to steal the toys and money of the other kids on the playground, but would always manage to blow it through his ineptitude. For example, there was this one time when he attempted to steal a lollipop from a baby. He managed to steal something, but it was the baby instead of the candy. Boy, he sure was embarrassed when he realized after eating. Rather than working at getting better at his passion, he always figured he should “leave good enough alone” and that any practice would just make him worse.


Items: Robin at the beginning of the game realizes that he left all his tools/items at home (except for a ladder which he uses to get to the top of the museum), looks like things might be harder than he thought.
